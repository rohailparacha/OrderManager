# OrderManager
A Laravel-based SaaS web application integrated with multiple high-end APIs for orders management. 

The application was integrated with SellerActive and Walmart to fetch orders and update their statuses. We integrated Keepa, Amazon MWS, Informed, and other APIs. 

One of the main tasks was optimizing the application to handle more than two million products and over one million orders. We used Redis, Indexing, and other techniques to keep it as optimized as possible. 

We also used background jobs, scheduling, queues, and other techniques for optimizing and managing internal processes efficiently.
